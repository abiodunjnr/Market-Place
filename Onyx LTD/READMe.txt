#### **Methodology**
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using **Power Query (M language)** to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.
   
2. **Data Modelling**: 
   - Created an efficient data model using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to establish relationships between different tables and support complex calculations. This allowed for the normalization of the data, ensuring fast queries and insights.

3. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Designed interactive dashboards in **Power BI** that provide stakeholders with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The dashboards enable users to filter, drill down, and interact with key metrics related to product performance, sales, defect rates, and more.

#### **Key Features**
- **Next-Level Table**:
   - Incorporated **HTML and CSS** to create a visually stunning table that displays product status in a button-like format, making it easy to track the status of products and highlight key performance indicators (KPIs).
   
- **Conditional Formatting**:
   - Used **conditional formatting** to dynamically highlight changes in defect rates, drawing attention to increasing or decreasing defect levels for timely action.

- **Drill-Down Functionality**:
   - Implemented drill-down capabilities to allow users to dive deeper into specific data points. This includes exploring product performance at a granular level, such as product categories, sales regions, and defect rates.

- **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - The dashboards are designed to be interactive, enabling users to explore the data dynamically with filters, slicers, and visualizations that respond in real-time. This ensures users can explore trends and correlations relevant to their needs.

- **Role-Based Security**:
   - Created security roles using **DAX** to ensure that different teams (e.g., skincare, haircare, and cosmetics) have access to only the data relevant to them. This enhances data privacy and ensures users see data that is specific to their department.

- **Display Folders**:
   - Used **display folders** to organize the data model and make it more readable. This allows for a clean, organized layout that enhances user experience when interacting with the data.
